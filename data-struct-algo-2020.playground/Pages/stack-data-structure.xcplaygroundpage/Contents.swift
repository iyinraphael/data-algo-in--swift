    # Stacks
    
    - There are only two essential operations for a stack
        1.  push: Adding an element to the top for a stack
        2.  pop: Removing the top element of the stack
    - A stack is known as a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure
    - iOS uses the navigation stack to push and pop view controllers into and out of view.
    - Memory allocation uses stacks at the architectural level. Memory for local variables is also managed using a stack.
    - Search and conquer algorithms, such as finding a path out of a maze, use stacks to facilitate backtracking.
